## From The Fog

# Fixed having multiple herobrines from time to time
# Changed "torch_trace" entity to a marker
# Fixed Herobrine's arms being too far away from his body
# Made it less likely for Herobrine to break torches
# Herobrine can now be seen watching you from the distance shortly after opening doors
# Swapped 20tick function to a schedule for better performance
# Removed sand pyramids in the ocean
