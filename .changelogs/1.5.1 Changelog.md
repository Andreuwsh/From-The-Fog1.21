# **v1.5.1 Changelog**

## **🚀 New Features**
- Added new Herobrine skins! (Apparition, Zombie, Nullified, Faceless, Distorted, Alex, Lick, Fallen Kingdom, Sculk Infested, and Netherbrine)
- Added 5 Custom Herobrine skins, which can be modified using another resourcepack. The template resourcepack can be downloaded [**HERE**](https://lunareclipse.studio/dl/From-The-Fog-Custom-Skin-Template.zip).
- Changed the experimental world settings screen to warn the player of a "unknown presence."
- Added new "Randomize Skins" setting. Changes whether or not Herobrine's skin randomizes everytime he appears.
- Added "Sighting Chance" config option, which adjusts the chance of Herobrine appearing.

## **🔧 Improvements**
- Changed the Herobrine skin to incorporate the newest clothing. (Not the whole skin because Mojang ruined it's face.)
- Changed the "Herobrine Skin" icons in the config from numbers to icons.
- Removed the ambient cave sound that can sometimes play after you hear footsteps.

## **🐛 Bug Fixes**
- Fixed Herobrine's model not being the same as a normal player's model.
- Fixed Herobrine's UV on his shoulders and head.

## **💻 Technical**
- Moved the skins options to it's own page for room for future skins.
- Added slim arm parent models at "assets/watching/models/item/herobrine/template"
- Added full body emissivity.
- Changed the title of "Glowing Eyes" to "Emissive Layers."
- Changed the config to have 4 options on each page rather than 3.
- Changed the 2x2 tunnels to check and place the redstone torches rather than checking and removing them. Also added a one second delay between chunk load and the torches placing; this will help to prevent issues on servers.
- Changed the torch_check tag to torchCheck.
